Over two weeks, we worked with [Donna Harold](https://facebook.com/DMH-Bespoke-Jewellery-880081235435001) to create pieces of jewellery using small ovular pieces of copper. The process involved hammering patterns into these pieces, including letters, numbers and symbols. After, we painted oxidiser over the finished pieces - turning them black - and sandpapered them, leaving only the embedded parts black. Then the pieces were attached to other parts to turn them into fully-fledged jewellery pieces.
