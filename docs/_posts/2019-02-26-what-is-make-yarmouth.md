The ‘Make Yarmouth’ project explores exciting practical arts skills – from fashion to furniture design – with inspiring international artists in a workshop space in central Great Yarmouth. Get inspired by amazing international artists, designers and architects through creative hands-on projects. There are opportunities to make something truly creative and unique whilst meeting new people, learning new skills and gaining an Arts Award qualification.
Each mini-project runs every Tuesday evening from 4:30pm to 7pm. All sessions are free to attend and further info or bookings can be made by contacting [Youth Engagement Officer Tricia Hall tricia.hall@norfolk.gov.uk](mailto:tricia.hall@norfolk.gov.uk)
